Priceless is a social media app that allows you to create posts now and send them to the future!
You can select a future date and time for showing your post at that selected time. (or you can just send your post at the current time without setting a future time for that.)
If you select to send your post to the future, then you also can set a price for that post, or meake it priceless.
If you set a price (in TON coin currency), then other users who can see your post, can buy it by sending TON coin to your wallet address(which you copy into your profile),
and then come back to the app and tap on "confirm transaction" button. a valid transaction should be like this:
1. user sends Ton from the wallet that he/she defined in his profile page.
2. user sends Ton to the wallet that belong to the post owner (defined in buy post activity).
3. the amount of sent TON must be equal to the price of post.
4. !!important!! the transaction must be the last transaction done by your wallet address.
When a transaction confirms then the post goes to sold posts collection of the post creator, and also goes to bought posts collection of buyer and disappears from timeline.
If you dont set a price for a future post, no one can see it untill the time comes for that post to be visible.
You can also add private comments and replies for posts and comments. Private comments are only visible to the writer of comment and the owner of post.
